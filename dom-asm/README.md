# DOM-ASM (Document Object Model - Automaton State Minimization)

## Overview
DOM-ASM is a specialized AST transformer that uses automaton state minimization to optimize HTML and CSS abstract syntax trees. It focuses on reducing the complexity of DOM structures while preserving their semantic meaning.

## Core Features
- AST-based HTML and CSS parsing
- State minimization for DOM tree optimization
- Token-based parsing with minimal overhead
- HTML/CSS structure preservation with reduced complexity

## Project Status: In Development ðŸš§

### Current Focus
1. AST Transformation
   - Building HTML/CSS AST structures
   - Implementing tree traversal and modification
   - Optimizing node relationships

2. State Minimization
   - Reducing redundant DOM states
   - Preserving semantic structure
   - Optimizing tree depth and complexity

3. Parser Development
   - HTML tokenizer implementation
   - CSS tokenizer implementation
   - AST builder optimization

## Development Principles

### AST-First Design
- Focus on tree structure optimization
- Maintain DOM semantics during transformation
- Prioritize node relationship efficiency

### Automaton Minimization
- Reduce state complexity in DOM trees
- Optimize parent-child relationships
- Minimize redundant node structures

## Installation 
```bash
npm install @obinexuscomputing/dom-asm
```

## Basic Usage
```typescript
import { HTMLParser, ASTOptimizer } from '@obinexuscomputing/dom-asm';

// Parse HTML to AST
const parser = new HTMLParser();
const ast = parser.parse('<div><span>text</span></div>');

// Optimize AST
const optimizer = new ASTOptimizer();
const minimizedAST = optimizer.minimize(ast);
```
